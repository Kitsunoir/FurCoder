	presentable. Added option for debug compile. Added updated
	FOX distribution to the included "tarball".

9 January, 2007 (Simo)
	* Made all icons *.xpm instead of *.png.

8 January, 2007 (Simo)

	  instead.

6 December, 2006 (Simo)
	* Major code re-write begin. De-kludge the encode mode functions to
	  streamline by removing unnecessary functions, fully use the line
	  edit to accumulate code additions for easier user editing. Improved
	  parse routines for better recognition of unnecessary text lines.

	  Removed dependency on gdbm for code decrypt. Use an FXDict
	  "dictionary" as light wieght database for decoding.

	  Added: code element character array for encoding, string indexing
	  for single character modifier look-up. Removed case switches for
	  making these selections.

	  Moved code element data into separate file of preprocessor macros
	  for easier modifications in case of Fur Code revisions.

	  Improved encode widget updating for more consistant presentation.

4 August, 2005 (Simo)
	* Minor bug fix to correct parse error in Furry themes decode. Also moved
	  the "uncertain" option to the option menus, and removed from the

19 September, 2004 (Simo)
	* Fully functional: added file open capability, and print capability.
	  Debugged the "Furry Occupations" decoder. Debugged the "Furry Species"
	  decoder for those cases where the user enters an exact species name
	  that contains white space.

	  Recoded the layout managers so that all widgets line up uniformly.

	  Added the necessary files for the GNU build tool-chain.

17 September, 2004 (Simo)
	* Added "exact species" capability to the "DecodeSpecies" function.

15 September, 2004 (Simo)
	* Added the "DecodeGender" function. Changed the code keys and code
	  meaning items for re-wroding, and a small bug fix (missing code
	  items added).

10 September, 2004 (Simo)
	* Added the functions "DecodeSpecies" and "DecodeOccu" to decode the
	  Furry species and RL Jobs categories.

6 September, 2004 (Simo)
	* Added the functions "DecodeSimple" and "DecodeComplex", for decoding
	  the simple code categories, and for handling those that include
	  the special modifications.

5 September, 2004 (Simo)
	* Created the Fur Code Keys and the Code Meaning items. Added gdbm database
	  capability to the main program to create this database when running for
	  first time and/or database files corrupted.
