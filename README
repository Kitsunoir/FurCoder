The FurCoderCXX is a graphical application intended for those affiliated with the
Furry Fandom. (If you have *no* idea what that means, then, obviously, you have
no use for this app.) This app allows you to quickly and easily create or decypher
a "Fur Code". Following the example of the "Geek Code" from the Usenet days, Fur
Codes allow one to reveal as much personal information as desired in very few
characters that are largely meaningless to the mundanes (i.e. outsiders).
(More details about the code itself are available via the on-line help.) Code
creation is done mainly by selections from menus to minimize errors. While not
exactly a critical matter, one doesn't want to present an error-ridden code that
marks one as a rank n00b.

The app also provides for decyphering any Fur Code. The code may be entered manually,
via copy-and-paste, or loaded from a file. Options to print and/or save to disk
are also available.

For more details on using the application, and the Fur Code itself, see the on-line
help.

FurCoderCXX was written with the FOX toolkit and XEMACS.
