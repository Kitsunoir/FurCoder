<p>In decode mode, the only active widgets are the main line edit, the OK command button, and the code display pane. The inactive widgets are used only in encode mode. The Fur Code to be decrypted may be loaded from a file, pasted into the line edit, pasted from the system clipboard, or be entered manually. Once this is done, simply click on "OK". The meaning of the code will be displayed for review, and/or saved to disk. As always, if you haven't saved, you will be prompted on exit. Other than that, there isn't much user involvement required to decrypt a Fur Code,
</p>
<p>
One included feature is the ability to decode a freshly created code. Once you have a code created, simply switch to decode mode from the toolbar or main menu, then click OK. Your code will display its results. There is no need to save, exit, and restart to review a new code.
</p>

<p>There is one problem that can occur during decode. The Furry Species category has three possible fields of modifiers: a "Themes" field consisting of single, lower-case letters, a "Furriness Rating" -- a number from 1 to 6, and a "Relationships" field, again, single lower-case letters. The problem arises in those cases where the code doesn't specify a numerical rating, yet does fill out the "Themes" and "Relationship" fields. These fields have <i>five</i> letters in common. This isn't a problem when the single number acts as a field delimiter. If that isn't there, any commonality of letters leads to ambiguity as to what the coder meant. This is a <b><i>MAJOR</i></b> oversight within the structure of the code itself. Perhaps a later revision will correct this problem? Till then, the Furry Coder will not allow a non-selection of this particular code modifier. Even though the select button displays a '0' character, this is not added to the code, serving only as a reminder that this selection has not been made yet.
</p>

<p>In those cases where the code to be interpreted contains malformed items, the FurCoderCXX will include error messages calling attention to these bad elements. This can happen for manually created codes, and/or "non-standard" versions of the Furry Code itself. There are also Fur Code apps out there that don't take as much care with how they create a Furry Code as this one does. An attempt will be made to extract whatever information is possible, however, complete failures are likely. (See <i>Diagnostics</i> for more details on how to deal with these situations.)</p>
